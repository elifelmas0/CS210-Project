CS210 Data Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project, titled "Spotify Music Listening Habits Analysis," is a comprehensive data analysis study conducted as part of the Introduction to Data Science (CS 210) course. The project utilizes Spotify streaming data to explore seasonal trends in music preferences, with a focus on comparing the summer period to the school period. The aim is to understand how these different times of the year influence music listening habits.
